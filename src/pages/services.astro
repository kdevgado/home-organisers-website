      <h2>Home Decluttering</h2>
      <p>Clear the excess and keep what serves you. We work zone by zone with a simple process: sort, decide, contain, label. I'll guide choices and organise donation or recycling where possible.</p>
      <p class="muted">Great for: pantries, wardrobes, kids' rooms, garages, linen cupboards.</p>

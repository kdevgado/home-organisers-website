    <h1>Before & After</h1>
    <p><strong>Real homes. Real results.</strong> Photos are on the way, but here’s what clients say after a session:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“I can find everything. Mornings are calmer.”</li>
      <li>“We donated what didn’t serve us and made space for what does.”</li>
      <li>“The pantry finally makes sense — and stays that way.”</li>
      <li>“I feel lighter walking into my home.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the gallery goes live, you’ll see pantries, wardrobes, linen presses, playrooms and garages transformed with simple, sustainable systems.</p>

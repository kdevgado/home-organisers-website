          <details>
            <summary>What areas of my home can be included?</summary>
            <p>
              We'll work with you to prioritise the spaces that will make the
              biggest difference - pantries, wardrobes, kids' rooms, linen
              cupboards, living areas, studies and more.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do I need to be on camera in the video?</summary>
            <p>
              You're welcome to appear in the video, but it's not required. You
              can simply film the spaces and record your voice explaining your
              situation.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>When will the organising sessions take place?</summary>
            <p>
              The sessions will be scheduled in consultation with each winner,
              subject to availability, between February and June 2026.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Are there any costs for winners?</summary>
            <p>
              The professional organising time is free for major prize winners.
              Any additional products (e.g. storage containers) can either be
              sourced from what you already own or purchased to suit your
              budget.

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><strong>Hi, we are your local home organisers - here to bring calm to chaos.</strong></p>
    <p>John and Rowee Delgado share a common passion: helping others and making a positive impact in their community.
John is an accredited disability support worker with nearly five years’ experience supporting NDIS clients, along with a decade in the food industry. His background has taught him patience, empathy, and a strong attention to detail.
Rowee brings a wealth of expertise with nine years in house design and eight years in government project management. She holds certificates in Social Housing and Business, and is highly skilled in problem-solving, contract management and budget planning.
Together, they apply a systematic and practical approach to decluttering and reorganising spaces. Their mission is to improve the quality of life, health, and well-being of the people they serve. By creating calm, functional environments, they help streamline daily routines and boost productivity.</p>

    <h2>Why we love organising</h2>
    <p>Order creates breathing room. Clear benches save time. A labelled tub can save a morning. Small changes add up to big peace, and we're all in on that transformation.</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect & discretion:</strong> Your home is private. I'm a guest.</li>
      <li><strong>Warmth without judgement:</strong> We keep what matters, let go of what doesn't.</li>
      <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to maintain systems that suit your lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Reuse, donate, and reduce waste wherever possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> On time, clear plans, honest quotes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What makes us different</h2>
    <p>Local knowledge of Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley — we get regional life, sport runs, harvest seasons, and spare rooms that do a lot of jobs. Our approach is gentle and encouraging, and the systems we set up are practical, not precious.</p>

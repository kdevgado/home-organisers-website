    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><strong>Hi, I'm your local organiser - here to bring calm to chaos.</strong></p>
    <p>I started this work because I love the relief on someone's face when a space finally makes sense. Homes are personal. They hold our stories, our seasons, and sometimes our stress. My job is to listen, simplify, and set up systems that stick.</p>

    <h2>Why I love organising</h2>
    <p>Order creates breathing room. Clear benches save time. A labelled tub can save a morning. Small changes add up to big peace, and I'm all in on that transformation.</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect & discretion:</strong> Your home is private. I'm a guest.</li>
      <li><strong>Warmth without judgement:</strong> We keep what matters, let go of what doesn't.</li>
      <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to maintain systems that suit your lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Reuse, donate, and reduce waste wherever possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> On time, clear plans, honest quotes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What makes me different</h2>
    <p>Local knowledge of Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley â€” I get regional life, sport runs, harvest seasons, and spare rooms that do a lot of jobs. My approach is gentle and encouraging, and the systems we set up are practical, not precious.</p>
